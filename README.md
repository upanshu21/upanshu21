I am a tech enthusiast who is very keen on learning new technologies. I started my coding journey with python but developed an interest in web development. I am a big football fan which is proved by the fact my first web page was a Lionel Messi fan page. But my interest was not limited to web development. I started exploring a bit of everything eventually starting my career as a software consultant and developer.
